This sample shows how to build an AI chat experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain4J and OpenAI language models. The application is hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) and [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview), with [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) as the vector database. You can use it as a starting point for building more complex AI applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸ‘‰ To learn how we built this sample and how you can run and deploy it, **follow the [full-length workshop](https://aka.ms/ws/openai-rag-quarkus)**.

## Overview

This sample uses [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) to create a [Java](https://openjdk.org/) service that leverage [OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/) and [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) to build a chatbot that will answer questions based on a corpus of documents, with a website to interact with the API.

This project is structured as monorepo, all packages source code is located under the `src/` folder.
Here's the architecture of the application:

## Run the sample

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to work on this project directly from your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codespaces-Open-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/azure-openai-rag-workshop-java?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&quickstart=true)

You can also use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and the [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) to work locally using a ready-to-use dev environment:

If you prefer to install all the tools locally, you can follow these [setup instructions](https://aka.ms/ws?src=gh%3AAzure-Samples%2Fazure-openai-rag-workshop-java%2Fdocs%2Fworkshop-java-quarkus.md&step=2#optional-working-locally-without-the-dev-container).

> [!TIP]
> You can run this sample entirely locally without any cost using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Follow the instructions above to setup the tools locally to get started.

### Azure prerequisites

- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) to get free Azure credits to get started. If you're a student, you can also get free credits with [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/azureforstudents).
- **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply).
- **Azure account permissions**:
  - Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](docs/deploy_existing.md#resource-group).
  - Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

### Deploy the sample

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

This commands will first ask you to log in into Azure. Then it will provison the Azure resources, package the services and deploy them to Azure.

## Other versions

This sample and workshop also exists in different versions:

- [**Node.js + Azure AI Search**](https://aka.ms/ws/openai-rag)
- [**Node.js + Qdrant**](https://aka.ms/ws/openai-rag-qdrant)
